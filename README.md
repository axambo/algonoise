Introduction
------------

**AlgoNoise** is an algorithmic DJ that produces algorithmic playlists for the dance floor. The generated playlist is a mix of EDM and electronic music genres including Dub Step, Techno, Breakbeat, Drum and Bass, Glitch, Chiptune and above all Noise and Concrete music. It combines sound samples from FreeSound.org and sounds generated by synthesis using SuperCollider.

Listen to examples of generated algorithmic playlists located in the `Examples` folder or here:

https://soundcloud.com/algonoise


Application Start
-----------------

The AlgoNoise application is based on the SuperCollider programming language.

http://supercollider.sourceforge.net

Drag the `AlgoNoise` folder located in the `SC Extension` folder to the Extensions folder of SuperCollider: `/Users/{username}/Library/Application Support/SuperCollider/Extensions` (in Mac)

Either recompile the class library (`Language>Recompile Class Library`) or restart SuperCollider.

As for the sound samples required to generate the playlist, create a folder within your personal directory with two subfolders: `input` for the sound samples that need to be loaded, and `output` for storing the generated DJ sessions. For this code to work, you need to download/copy to the `input` folder all the sound samples listed below in `Sound credits`.


Usage
-----

Start the application by typing `NoiseMachines.new(path)` on the SuperCollider IDE. `path` should be replaced by the full path to the folder that you created in your personal directory, explained above.

A new song will be created by typing and executing `x.playsong` and recorded as a `wav` file. The algorithmic DJ session lasts for 15 minutes. A text file with a list of the FreeSound samples used will be created. Subsequently executing again the lines of code `NoiseMachines.new(path)` and `x.playsong` will create a new playlist.

For stopping the recording of the playlist earlier than the established 15 minutes, type `s.stopRecording`, then `Language > Stop` or `CMD + Period`.

For convenience, there is a RunMe.sc file that includes these two lines of code.

There is a random component in both the generation/selection of sounds, as well as on the control structure of the playlist. The random engine is self-contained, and executing the code again will retrieve a new algorithmic playlist.
